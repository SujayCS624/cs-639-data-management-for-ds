      "Query: What is the course code number for Data Management for Data Science?\n",

      "\n",
      "Query: What NoSQL database was the main focus of project P2 in CS639?\n",
      " Response: The main focus of Project P2 in CS639 was MySQL, which is a type of relational database management system (RDBMS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Query: Can you explain window functions as taught in this course?\n",
      " Response: Window functions, as taught in this course, are special types of SQL functions that allow you to perform calculations across a specific subset of rows within a database table. Unlike aggregate functions, which collapse the rows into a single result (e.g., SUM, AVG), window functions maintain the original rows and provide a way to calculate statistics for each row in relation to other rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the key concepts and clauses associated with window functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Over Clause: This clause defines the window or partition over which the function will be applied. It determines which rows are considered for the calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Order By Clause: This clause specifies the order of rows within the window. It is used in conjunction with the over clause to define the order in which the rows are processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Partition By Clause: This clause divides the original table into partitions, where each partition contains rows with the same values for the specified columns. Each partition is treated independently when applying window functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Aggregate Functions: These are functions that perform calculations on a set of values, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX. Window functions can be used with aggregate functions to calculate statistics for each row based on the window defined by the over, order by, and partition by clauses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Window Frames: Window frames define the subset of rows within a window that are used for calculations. Common window frames include ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING, ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW, and ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Ranking Functions: These are specific types of window functions that assign a rank to each row within a window based on a specified order. Examples include RANK, DENSE_RANK, and ROW_NUMBER.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, window functions enable you to perform calculations on a subset of rows within a table, while maintaining the original rows. They are useful for analyzing data in a more nuanced way, such as calculating running totals, moving averages, or ranking rows based on specific criteria. The over, order by, and partition by clauses, along with window frames and ranking functions, provide the necessary tools to define and manipulate these subsets\n",
      "\n",
      "Query: What SQL query clauses did we learn about in this course?\n",
      " Response: In this course, we learned about the following SQL query clauses:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SELECT clause: Used for projection, which enables us to select specific columns or all columns from a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FROM clause: Specifies the relation name (table) from which data is retrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. WHERE clause: Used for filtering data based on specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. GROUP BY clause: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. HAVING clause: Used to filter groups based on conditions that involve aggregate functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. ORDER BY clause: Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. OVER clause: Used with window functions to define a window or partition over which the function operates.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. PARTITION BY clause: Used with window functions to divide the result set into partitions based on specified columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. WINDOW clause: Used with window functions to define the window or partition over which the function operates.\n",
