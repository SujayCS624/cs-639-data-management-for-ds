It was founded in 1848 when Wisconsin achieved statehood and is both the official state university of Wisconsin and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. The 933-acre (378 ha) main campus is located on the shores of Lake Mendota and includes four National Historic Landmarks. The university also owns and operates the 1,200-acre (486 ha) University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Arboretum 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the main campus.\nUW\u2013Madison is organized into 13 schools and colleges, which enrolled 35,184 undergraduate, 9,993 graduate, 2,046 special, and 2,663 professional students in 2022. Its academic programs include 136 undergraduate majors, 148 master's degree programs, and 120 doctoral programs.\nWisconsin is one of the twelve founding members of the Association of American Universities, a selective group of major research universities in North America. It is considered a Public Ivy, and is classified as an R1 University. UW\u2013Madison was also the home of both the prominent \"Wisconsin School\" of economics and diplomatic history. The National Science Foundation ranked UW\u2013Madison 8th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2022 with $1.52 billion (equivalent to $1,582,569,934 in 2023). As of March 2023, 20 Nobel laureates, 41 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 Fields medalists, and 1 Turing Award recipient have been affiliated with UW\u2013Madison as alumni, faculty, or researchers. It is also a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars and MacArthur Fellows. As of November 2018, 14 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies attended UW\u2013Madison, the most of any university in the nation.\nThe Wisconsin Badgers compete in 25 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference and have won 31 national championships. Wisconsin students and alumni have won 50 Olympic medals (including 13 gold medals).\n\nHistory\nEstablishment\nThe university had its official beginnings when the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a \"University of the Territory of Wisconsin\", and a high-ranking board of visitors was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the UW board of regents) never actually accomplished anything before Wisconsin was incorporated as a state in 1848.\nThe Wisconsin Constitution provided for \"the establishment of a state university, at or near the seat of state government...\" and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a board of regents and administered by a Chancellor. On July 26, 1848, Nelson Dewey, Wisconsin's first governor, signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin. John H. Lathrop became the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849. With John W. Sterling as the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at Madison Female Academy on February 5, 1849.\nA permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of 50 acres (20.2 ha) \"bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street\", [later State Street] \"south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake.\" The regents' building plans called for a \"main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations.\" This building, University Hall, now known as Bascom Hall, was finally completed in 1859. On October 10, 1916, a fire destroyed the building's dome, which was never replaced. North Hall, constructed in 1851, was actually the first building on campus. In 1854, Levi Booth and Charles T. Wakeley became the first graduates of the university, and in 1892 the university awarded its first PhD to future university president Charles R. Van Hise.\n\nLate 19th century\nFemale students were first admitted to the University of Wisconsin during the American Civil War in 1863. The Wisconsin State Legislature formally designated the university as the Wisconsin land-grant institution in 1866. In 1875, William Smith Noland became the first known African-American to graduate from the university.\nScience Hall was constructed in 1888 as one of the world's first buildings to use I-beams. On April 4, 1892, the first edition of the student-run The Daily Cardinal was published. In 1894 an unsuccessful attempt was made by Oliver Elwin Wells, Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin to expel Richard T. Ely from his chair of director of the School of Economics, Political Science, and History at Wisconsin for purportedly teaching socialistic doctrines. This effort failed, with the Wisconsin state Board of Regents issuing a ringing proclamation in favor of academic freedom, acknowledging the necessity for freely \"sifting and winnowing\" among competing claims of truth.\n\nEarly 20th century and the Wisconsin Idea\nResearch, teaching, and service at the UW is influenced by a tradition known as \"the Wisconsin Idea\", first articulated by UW\u2013Madison President Charles Van Hise in 1904, when he declared \"I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state.\" The Wisconsin Idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state, and that the research conducted at UW\u2013Madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the environment, and agriculture for all citizens of the state. The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government. Based in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.\nDuring this period, numerous significant research milestones were met, including the discoveries of Vitamin A and Vitamin B in 1913 and 1916, respectively, by Elmer V. McCollum and Marguerite Davis, as well as the \"Single-grain experiment\" conducted by Stephen Moulton Babcock and Edwin B. Hart from 1907 to 1911, paving the way for modern nutrition as a science. In 1923, Harry Steenbock invented process for adding vitamin D to milk and in 1925, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was chartered to control patenting and patent income on UW\u2013Madison inventions. The UW Graduate School had been separated in 1904-1905.\nIn 1909, William Purdy and Paul Beck wrote On, Wisconsin, the UW\u2013Madison athletic fight song.  Radio station 9XM, the oldest continually operating radio station in the United States, was founded on campus in 1919 (now WHA (970 AM). The Memorial Union opened in 1928, and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Arboretum opened in 1934.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin Experimental College was a two-year college designed and led by Alexander Meiklejohn in 1927 with a great books, liberal arts curriculum. Students followed a uniform curriculum that sought to teach democracy and foster an intrinsic love of learning, but the college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy in which students lived and worked with their teachers, had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. The Great Depression and lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's closure in 1932.\nIn 1936, UW\u2013Madison began an artist-in-residence program with John Steuart Curry, the first ever at a university. In the 1940s, Warfarin (Coumadin) was developed at UW by the laboratory of Karl Paul Link and named after the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. During World War II, the University of Wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n\nLate 20th century to present\nOver time, additional campuses were added to the university. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee was created in 1956, and UW\u2013Green Bay and UW\u2013Parkside in 1968. Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system. In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the Wisconsin State Universities System, creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents.\nUW\u2013Madison's Howard Temin, a virologist, co-discovered the enzyme reverse transcriptase in 1969, and The Badger Herald was founded as a conservative student paper the same year.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW\u2013Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film The War at Home. The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of recruiters for the Dow Chemical Company, which supplied the napalm used in the Vietnam War. Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book, They Marched into Sunlight, as well as the PBS documentary Two Days in October. Among the students injured in the protest was former Madison mayor Paul Soglin.\nAnother target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to US Department of Defense requests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted \"U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!\" On August 24, 1970, near 3:40 am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center. Despite the late hour, a post doctoral physics researcher, Robert Fassnacht, was in the lab and was killed in the explosion. The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected. Karleton Armstrong, Dwight Armstrong, and David Fine were found responsible for the blast. Leo Burt was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.\nIn 1998, UW\u2013Madison's James Thomson first isolated and cultured human embryonic stem cells.\n\nCampus\nLocated in Madison, about a mile from the state capitol, the main campus of the university is situated partially on the isthmus between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona. The main campus comprises 933 acres (378 ha) of land, while the entire campus, including research stations throughout the state, is over 10,600 acres (4,290 ha) in area. The central campus is on an urban layout mostly coinciding with the city of Madison's street grid, exceptions being the suburban University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, and the Department of Psychiatry & Clinics in the West Side research park. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Arboretum, a demonstration area for native ecosystems, is located on the west side of Madison. The main campus includes many buildings designed or supervised by architects J.T.W. Jennings and Arthur Peabody. The hub of campus life is the Memorial Union. UW\u2013Madison's campus has been ranked as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States by Travel + Leisure and Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler. One unusual feature of the campus is the Babcock Hall dairy plant and store, a fully functional dairy well known for its ice cream.\n\nBascom Hill\nAs one of the icons on campus, Bascom Hall, at the top of Bascom Hill, is often considered the \"heart of the campus.\" Built in 1857, a decorative dome that once sat atop the structure was destroyed by fire in 1916. The structure has been added to several times over the years. The building currently houses the office of the chancellor and vice chancellors. Bascom Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building within the Bascom Hill Historic District.\nFlanking both sides of Bascom Hall are the two oldest surviving buildings on campus. Designed by John F. Rague in a Federal style, the oldest structure in the university, North Hall (built in 1851), was planned to be similar to the dormitories at the University of Michigan. It is still in use as the home of the Department of Political Science. Its opposite twin, South Hall (built in 1855), originally served as the women's dormitory prior to the establishment of the Female College Building in 1871 (today the location of Chadbourne Hall). The administrative offices of the College of Letters and Science now occupy the building.\n\nThe Carillon Tower, erected in 1936, was designed by Warren Powers Laird and Paul Philippe Cret so that the balustrade echoes that on Bascom Hall. The carillon has 56 bronze bells, with the largest weighing 6,800 pounds. An automated system rings bells on the hour, playing songs such as \"Varsity\" and \"On, Wisconsin!\". East of the tower, lies a monument to the Sauk leader Black Hawk, whose flight through the Madison area represented the last armed conflict between the United States Army and native peoples in southern Wisconsin.\nSeveral other notable architectural styles are represented in the historic core of the university. Following the 1884 fire that destroyed the original, Milwaukee architect Henry C. Koch designed the new Science Hall (built in 1888) in a Romanesque Revival style. The Education Building, originally designed to house the College of Engineering, features a Beaux-Arts style. Structures built in a Neoclassical style include Birge Hall and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Located at the foot of the hill, Music Hall was designed in 1878 by Madison architect David R. Jones in a Gothic Revival style.\nVan Hise Hall is home to most of the languages departments of the university and the upper floors house the offices of the University of Wisconsin System's president and its Board of Regents. At 241 feet and 19 stories, Van Hise is the second-tallest building in Madison and one of the tallest educational buildings in the world. Because of its placement atop Bascom Hill it towers over the State Capitol as the building with the highest elevation in the city. Van Hise Hall was constructed in 1967 and its destruction is slated for sometime around 2025 as part of the university's campus master plan.\nThe George L. Mosse Humanities Building, located on Library Mall, was built in the late 1960s in the Brutalist style. Although debunked, the campus myth is that the building (with its poor ventilation, narrow windows, inclined base, and cantilevered upper floors) was designed to be \"riot-proof\". Its seven floors house the history, art, and music departments. The most recent campus master plan calls for it to be demolished and replaced with two other buildings, in part because of water damage.\n\nWisconsin Union\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison has two student unions. The older, Memorial Union, was built in 1928 to honor American World War I veterans. Also known as the Union or the Terrace, it has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus. Located on the shore of Lake Mendota, it is a popular spot for socializing among both students and the public, who enjoy gazing at the lake and its sailboats. The union is known for the Rathskeller, a German pub adjacent to the lake terrace. Political debates and backgammon and sheepshead games over a beer on the terrace are common among students. The Rathskeller serves \"Rathskeller Ale\", a beer brewed expressly for the Terrace. Memorial Union was the first union at a public university to serve beer.\n\nMemorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craft shop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory referendum to renovate and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university completed the renovation in 2017.\nUnion South was first built in 1971 to better accommodate a growing student enrollment. The original structure was demolished in 2008 and replaced with a LEED-certified building which opened in 2011. The building contains several dining options, an art gallery, a movie theater, a climbing wall, a bowling alley, event spaces, and a hotel.\nThe Wisconsin Union also provides a home for the Wisconsin Union Directorate Student Programming Board, which provides regular programs for both students and community members. One of the most well-known members is the Wisconsin Hoofers, a club that organizes outdoor recreational activities.\n\nHenry Mall\nHenry Mall is a 50-foot wide and 575-foot long landscaped quadrangle that was designed by architects Warren Laird and Paul Cret and constructed between 1903 and 1961. The mall contains buildings that represent Neoclassical, Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance Revival, and Modern Movement styles of architecture. Laird and Cret were hired to draw up a master plan for future construction at the campus, with the idea of creating a more unified and aesthetically pleasing area. The departments around the Henry Mall area were conceived to be \"technical\" and geographically close to the science departments and the university farm.\nThe Mall features several notable buildings, including Agriculture Hall, the Agronomy Building, the Agricultural Engineering Building, and the Agricultural Chemistry Building. The Mall is also home to several artworks, including the Hoard statue by Gutzon Borglum, which honors William Dempster Hoard, the publisher of Hoard's Dairyman magazine. The Henry Boulder, a chunk of gneiss on the mall with a plaque, is dedicated to Dean William Arnon Henry, the mall's namesake, who helped establish the College of Agriculture. Other buildings in the area include the Stovall Lab of Hygiene and the Genetics Building. The Henry Mall Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\n\nMuseums\nThe Geology Museum features rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world. Highlights include a blacklight room, a walk-through cave, and a fragment of the Barringer meteorite. Some noteworthy fossils include the first dinosaur skeleton assembled in Wisconsin (an Edmontosaurus), a shark (Squalicorax) and a floating colony of sea lilies (Uintacrinus), both from the Cretaceous chalk of Kansas, and the Boaz Mastodon, a found on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin in 1897.\nThe Chazen Museum of Art, formerly the Elvehjem Museum of Art, maintains a collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints and photographs spanning over 700 years of art.\nThe university's Zoological Museum maintains a collection of approximately 500,000 zoological specimens, which can be used for research and instruction. A special collection contains skeletons, artifacts, and research papers associated with the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Since 1978, the UW\u2013Madison Zoological Museum has been one of only three museums granted permission by the Ecuadoran Government to collect anatomical specimens from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nThe L. R. Ingersoll Physics Museum contains a range of exhibits demonstrating classical and modern physics. Many of the exhibits allow for hands-on interaction by visitors. The museum also has a number of historical instruments and pictures on display.\n\nEffigy mounds\nUW\u2013Madison claims more distinct archaeological sites than on any other university campus. The campus contains four clusters of effigy mounds located at Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point, and Eagle Heights. These sites, reflecting thousands of years of human habitation in the area, have survived to a greater or lesser degree on campus, depending on location and past building activities. Surviving sites are marked and fenced on the campus, ensuring that they are not disturbed. Wisconsin statutes protect effigy mounds by giving them a five-foot buffer zone. The Lakeshore Nature Preserve Committee is endeavoring to \"...safeguard beloved cultural landscapes,\" through aggressive enforcement of measures for the preservation of such zones and advocating for broader buffers where possible.\n\nOrganization and administration\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is divided into eight main undergraduate schools and colleges and four main professional schools, some of which have further divisions:\n\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\nSchool of Business\nSchool of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies\nGraduate School\nSchool of Human Ecology\nLaw School\nCollege of Letters & Science\nSchool of Computer, Data & Information Sciences\nMead Witter School of Music\nSchool of Journalism & Mass Communication\nSchool of Social Work\nSchool of Library and Information Studies\nRobert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs\nSchool of Medicine and Public Health\nSchool of Nursing\nSchool of Pharmacy\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nUW\u2013Madison is governed by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, which governs each of the state's 13 comprehensive public universities. The board has 18 members; 16 are appointed by the governor of Wisconsin, while two are students of the system. Furthermore, the elected superintendent of public instruction serves as an ex-officio member. The board establishes the regulations and budgets for the university and appoints the chancellor. Jennifer Mnookin, former dean of the UCLA School of Law, has served as the chancellor of UW\u2013Madison since 2022.\n\nAcademics\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System, is a large, four-year research university comprising twenty associated colleges and schools. In addition to undergraduate and graduate divisions in agriculture and life sciences, business, education, engineering, human ecology, journalism and mass communication, letters and science, music, nursing, pharmacy, and social welfare, the university also maintains graduate and professional schools in environmental studies, law, library and information studies, medicine and public health (School of Medicine and Public Health), public affairs, and veterinary medicine.\nThe four year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as \"arts and science plus professions\" with a high graduate coexistence. The largest university college, the College of Letters and Science, enrolls approximately half of the undergraduate student body and is made up of 38 departments and five professional schools that instruct students and carry out research in a wide variety of fields, such as astronomy, economics, geography, history, linguistics, and zoology. The graduate instructional program is classified by Carnegie as \"comprehensive with medical/veterinary.\" In 2008, it granted the third largest number of doctorates in the nation.\n\nAdmissions\nThe Princeton Review ranked the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's undergraduate admissions selectivity a 92/99.

Fellows are required to live in the Madison, Wisconsin area for the duration of their fellowships, teach one creative writing workshop each semester, assist in judging the English department's writing contests and fellowships, and give a public reading.\nThe Wisconsin Institute for Creative Writing was founded in 1985 by the poet Ronald Wallace, who taught at the University of Wisconsin's English department from 1972 to 2015. WICW was created \"to provide time, space, and an intellectual community for writers working on a first book of poetry or fiction.\" In 2012, the Institute expanded its fellowship eligibility requirements to include writers who have published only one book-length work of creative writing. From 2008 to 2014, it offered the Carl Djerassi Distinguished Playwriting Fellowship in addition to fiction and poetry fellowships.\nFellowship applications are judged anonymously until finalists are chosen. However, \"it is the work and the work alone that really matters,\" says Jesse Lee Kercheval, in a conversation with the Association of Writers and Writing Programs.\n\nInstitute for Science Education and Community Engagement\nThe Wisconsin Institute for Science Education and Community Engagement (WISCIENCE) is a unit that facilitates coordination of science outreach efforts across the university and works to improve science education at all levels.\n\nResearch\nUW\u2013Madison was a founding member of the Association of American Universities. In fiscal year 2022, the school received $1.524 billion in research and development (R&D) funding, placing it eighth in the U.S. among institutions of higher education. Its research programs were fourth in the number of patents issued in 2010.\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is one of 33 sea grant colleges in the United States. These colleges are involved in scientific research, education, training, and extension projects geared toward the conservation and practical use of U.S. coasts, the Great Lakes and other marine areas.\n\nThe university maintains almost 100 research centers and programs, ranging from agriculture to arts, from education to engineering. It has been considered a major academic center for embryonic stem cell research ever since UW\u2013Madison professor James Thomson became the first scientist to isolate human embryonic stem cells. This has brought significant attention and respect for the university's research programs from around the world. The university continues to be a leader in stem cell research, helped in part by the funding of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and promotion of WiCell.\nIts center for research on internal combustion engines, called the Engine Research Center, has a five-year collaboration agreement with General Motors. It has also been the recipient of multimillion-dollar funding from the federal government.\nThe Department of Engineering Physics conducts research to advance the scientific and technical basis for magnetic fusion energy. They have over 20 current graduate students and recruit new students annually. Their research includes non-inductive startup techniques, investigation of ion gyro-scale turbulent instabilities and dynamics, understanding core-edge coupling, and development of diagnostic systems. The UW also hosts the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX), which is a modular coil stellarator.\nIn June 2013, it was reported that the United States National Institutes of Health would fund an $18.13 million study at the University of Wisconsin. The study will research lethal qualities of viruses such as Ebola, West Nile and influenza. The goal of the study is to help find new drugs to fight off the most lethal pathogens.\nIn 2012, UW\u2013Madison experiments on cats came under fire from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals who claimed the animals were abused. In 2013, the NIH briefly suspended the research's funding pending an agency investigation. The following year the university was fined more than $35,000 for several violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Bill Maher, James Cromwell and others spoke out against the experiments that ended in 2014. The university defended the research and the care the animals received claiming that PETA's objections were merely a \"stunt\" by the organization.\n\nStudent life\nResidential life\nThe university runs over twenty residence halls, including learning communities and affinity communities. These are spread across two distinct neighborhoods: Lakeshore and Southeast. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,250 students, while the smallest is home to 30 residents. Nestled against Lake Mendota, the Lakeshore Neighborhood is home to thirteen residence halls and four dining markets. The neighborhood is close to Ebling and Steenbock Libraries and the Engineering campus. The Southeast Neighborhood, near downtown Madison, is home to eight residence halls and two dining markets. The Lakeshore and Southeast neighborhoods are considered to be rivals owing to their contrasting lifestyles. Southeast dorms are considered to be more social, while Lakeshore dorms tend to be more quiet. In winter, the two sides meet at Bascom Hill for a snowball fight that draws hundreds of students known as the \"Battle for Bascom\".\n\nBarnard Residence Hall, the oldest functioning residential building on campus, opened its doors in the fall of 1913 as the second women's dormitory. The building features an Italian Renaissance Revival style and owes its namesake to former Chancellor Henry Barnard, who, ironically, opposed student housing on campus believing it to be a drain on the institution's income. Alongside neighboring Chadbourne Residence Hall, Barnard Hall is part of the Chadbourne Residential College, a building-wide living-learning community. Barnard Residence Hall is connected to Rheta's Market, a buffet-style dining hall.\nOn May 22, 2012, the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin passed a resolution permitting the usage of the name \"Dejope\", a variation of the original Ho-chunk term, for a new residence hall at the university. Teejop means \"Four Lakes\" in the Ho-Chunk language, and Native Americans have used this word to describe the Madison area for thousands of years. The building and its grounds contain imagery of the mounds and lakes in the area and include a fire circle that overlooks Lake Mendota. Dejope Hall pays tribute to its name with the Four Lakes Market, which features an authentic canoe.\n\nMedia\nStudent publications\nUW\u2013Madison is the only university in the country with two daily student newspapers: The Daily Cardinal, founded in 1892 and The Badger Herald, founded in 1969. The Onion was founded in 1988 by two UW\u2013Madison juniors, and was published in Madison before moving to New York City in 2001. It is also the home of The Madison Misnomer, an undergraduate comedy newspaper, founded in 2007.\nUW\u2013Madison is also home to one of only two nationally distributed undergraduate international studies journals in the country. The Journal of Undergraduate International Studies (JUIS) is a competitive publication that features peer-reviewed academic articles. It was founded in 2003 by David Coddon with the support of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Leadership Trust.\n\nCampus radio\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison campus radio station is WSUM 91.7 FM, \"The Snake on the Lake\". Historically, UW\u2013Madison has been home to a collection of student run radio stations, a number of which stopped broadcasting after run-ins with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The current radio station, WSUM, began in 1997 in a webcast only format because of the prolonged battle to get an FCC license and construct a tower. This lasted five years until February 22, 2002, when the station started broadcasting over FM airwaves at 91.7 from its tower in Montrose, Wisconsin. The radio station currently has around 200 volunteer DJs and eight paid managers. All UW\u2013Madison students, as well as a limited number of community members, are eligible to participate in running the station. WSUM remains entirely free format, which means that the on-air personnel can showcase a large variety of music and talk programming at their discretion with few limitations. WSUM has garnered many awards from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association for their news, play-by-play broadcasts of Badger athletic events, and unique public service announcements.\n\nOrganizations\nOver 800 student organizations or clubs are registered with the Center for Leadership and Involvement (CFLI) at UW\u2013Madison each year.\nStudent organizations at the school include chapters of the fraternities Acacia, Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Gamma Rho, Delta Chi, Chi Psi, and Sigma Alpha. Alpha Chi Sigma was founded at the university in 1902.\nReligious student organizations include affiliates of the Christian organizations Athletes in Action, Chi Alpha Campus Ministries, and the Christian Legal Society. Pres House is a progressive student organization loosely associated with the PCUSA that welcomes students of all backgrounds to its worship and various other gatherings. Wisconsin Lutheran Chapel is a Christian chapel and campus ministry that serves students of UW\u2013Madison.\nUW is also home to student vehicles teams such as Formula SAE combustion and electric, Baja SAE, SAE Clean Snow, ASME Human Powered Vehicle, Wisconsin Autonomous, Concrete Canoe and formerly the UW Hybrid Vehicle Team and Badgerloop.\nThere are 8 A cappella groups on the UW\u2013Madison campus. Of them, two are mixed-voice, two are lower voice, two are upper voice, and two are themed mixed-voice. The groups are the MadHatters, Redefined A Cappella, Fundamentally Sound, Pitches and Notes, Tangled up in Blue, Under A-Rest, Jewop, and Wisconsin Waale.\n\nAthletics\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison sports teams participate in the NCAA's Division I-A. With the exception of lightweight Wisconsin Badgers Crew, the university's athletic programs compete in the Big Ten Conference. The women's hockey program competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), while the men's and women's crew programs compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges and Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges, respectively. The school's fight song is \"On, Wisconsin!\". The school's mascot is Buckingham U. Badger, commonly referred to as \"Bucky Badger\". The athletic director is Chris McIntosh.\n2005\u20132006 marked the first time in school history that four Badger teams won national championships in the same academic year. In the fall, the men's cross country team won its fourth national championship. The winter season was highlighted by the men's and women's ice hockey teams both winning national titles. The year was capped off in the spring with the women's lightweight crew taking its third straight Intercollegiate Rowing Association national crown. In 2008, both men's and women's crew teams claimed national titles.\n\nFootball\nThe Badgers play college football at Camp Randall Stadium. The head coach is Luke Fickell. Before the fourth quarter of every game at Camp Randall, the crowd jumps around to House of Pain's song \"Jump Around\". After every game, the University of Wisconsin Marching Band plays popular songs during the Fifth Quarter. The Badgers won three Rose Bowl Championships under Barry Alvarez in 1994, 1999, and 2000. In 2006, Bret Bielema led the Badgers to a school record (at that time) 11-win regular season and to 12 overall wins, defeating Arkansas in the Capital One Bowl. Coach Paul Chryst would later break that record as he led the Badgers to 12 regular season wins in the 2017\u20132018 campaign, as well as a 34\u201324 victory over Miami in the Orange Bowl, for a season total of 13 wins. Chryst also won a Cotton Bowl the year before the Orange Bowl win.\nThe Badgers lost to TCU in the 2011 Rose Bowl Championship on January 1, 2011. In the 2011 season, the Badgers defended the B1G championship title to go to the 2012 Rose Bowl Championship. The Badgers lost to Oregon 45\u201338 in the highest-scoring Rose Bowl of all time. The Badgers made it to the 2013 Rose Bowl for their third consecutive Rose Bowl appearance. Bret Bielema took the Arkansas football head coaching position before the game and Barry Alvarez took over as a one-game interim coach. The Badgers lost to Stanford 14\u201320 for Barry Alvarez's first Rose Bowl loss, he had previously won it three times.\n\nMen's basketball\nThe Badgers have made 19 consecutive appearances (1999\u20132017) in the NCAA Tournament, having played in the National Championship game in 2015, making Final Four visits in 2000 and 2014, an Elite Eight appearance in 2005, and Sweet Sixteen appearances in 2003, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2017. Bo Ryan was the head coach from 2001 to 2015. Greg Gard is the current head coach.  The Badgers play at the Kohl Center, where the student fans are known as AreaRED. In the 2006\u20132007 season, the Badgers attained their highest AP ranking in school history (#1 Feb 19\u201325), garnering 35 first-place votes. The Badgers earned their only NCAA National Championship in 1941.\n\nWomen's basketball\nWomen's ice hockey\nIce hockey\nBadger ice hockey first became a men's varsity sport in 1922. Although dropped after the 1934\u201335 season, it again became a varsity sport in the 1963\u201364 season. The men's team played in the Dane County Coliseum until moving to the Kohl Center (capacity 15,359) in the fall of 1998. The first ice hockey game played at the Kohl was the Hall of Fame game against the University of Notre Dame. From 1999 to 2012 the men's team led the nation in college hockey attendance, setting an NCAA attendance record (averaging 15,048) during the 2009\u201310 season, which surpassed their previous record set in 2006\u201307.\nBob Johnson, nicknamed \"Badger Bob\" by fans, took over the reins in 1966. Johnson coached the Badger men to three national championships in 1973, 1977 and 1981. Jeff Sauer coached the Badger men to two more titles in 1983 and 1990. Mike Eaves, member of the 1977 NCAA title team, coached the Badger men's team to its sixth national championship in 2006. The six Badger titles rank fourth in NCAA men's ice hockey history. Eaves' 2010 squad advanced to the national championship game during the Badgers' 11th appearance in the men's Frozen Four before bowing to Boston College.\nThe school's strong ice hockey tradition gained another dimension with the addition of a women's team that began play in the 1999\u20132000 season. Coached by Mark Johnson, son of \"Badger Bob\" and another member of the men's 1977 title team, the Badger women won their first NCAA championship on March 26, 2006. The dual 2006 titles marked the first time that both the men's and women's Division I NCAA hockey titles were won by the same school in the same year. The women's team repeated as national champions in 2007 with a victory over the University of Minnesota-Duluth and in 2009 with a victory over Mercyhurst. The team set the NCAA women's hockey attendance record on February 15, 2014, in a game against Minnesota.\n\nRivalries\nThe Wisconsin Badgers' most notable rivalry within the Big Ten is with the Minnesota Golden Gophers, which is the most-played rivalry in Division I-A football. In their annual college football game, the teams compete for Paul Bunyan's Axe. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each team's wins earn points for their university. Wisconsin's other prominent rivalries in football are with the Iowa Hawkeyes and Nebraska Cornhuskers.\nThe I-94 rivalry between Wisconsin men's basketball and the in-state Marquette Golden Eagles has been played annually since 1958. Other basketball rivalries include the Michigan State Spartans and Illinois Fighting Illini within the Big Ten.\nThe Wisconsin men's and women's hockey teams' most recognized rivals are Minnesota and the North Dakota Fighting Hawks. Other rivals include the Denver Pioneers, Colorado College Tigers, Michigan Tech Huskies, Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs, and St. Cloud State Huskies.\n\nMascot\nThe school mascot is an anthropomorphized badger named Bucky who dons a sweater affixed with the UW\u2013Madison athletic logo (currently the red \"Motion W\"). Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly badger who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the \"Badgers\", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or \"Bucky\", for short.\nAt Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.\nThe team's nickname originates from the state nickname. In the 1820s, many lead miners and their families lived in the mines in which they worked until adequate above-ground shelters were built, and thus were compared to badgers.\nIn 2009, Fulton Market Films produced the documentary Being Bucky which followed the lives of seven Wisconsin students who take on the role of Bucky Badger. Being Bucky won \"Best Documentary Film\" at the Wisconsin Film Festival and went on to play in local Wisconsin movie theaters.\n\nNotable people\nAlumni\nOver its history, UW\u2013Madison alumni, faculty, or former faculty have distinguished themselves in a wide variety of fields, and have been awarded 20 Nobel Prizes and 41 Pulitzer Prizes.

                    "wiki": "Madison is the capital city of the U.S. state of Wisconsin and the seat of Dane County. The population was 269,840 as of the 2020 census, making it the second-most populous city in Wisconsin, after Milwaukee, and the 77th-most populous in the United States. The Madison metropolitan area had a population of 680,796. The city is located on an isthmus and lands surrounding five lakes\u2014Lake Mendota, Lake Monona, Lake Wingra, Lake Kegonsa and Lake Waubesa. Madison was founded in 1836 and is named after American Founding Father and President James Madison.\nAs the state capital, Madison is home to government chambers including the Wisconsin State Capitol building. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System, is located in the city. Other cultural institutions include the Henry Vilas Zoo, Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Olbrich Botanical Gardens, Overture Center for the Arts, and Wisconsin Historical Museum. Madison is home to an extensive network of parks, the most parks and playgrounds per capita of any of the 100 largest U.S. cities, and is considered a bicycle-friendly community. Madison is also home to nine National Historic Landmarks, including several buildings designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, such as the UNESCO World Heritage Site Jacobs I House.\nResidents of Madison are known as Madisonians. Madison has long been a center for progressive political activity, protests, and demonstrations, and contemporary Madison is considered the most politically liberal city in Wisconsin. The presence of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, as well as other educational institutions has a significant impact on the economy, culture, and demographics of Madison.\nAs of 2021, Madison is the fastest-growing city in Wisconsin. Madison's economy features a large and growing technology sector, and the Madison area is home to the headquarters of Epic Systems, American Family Insurance, Exact Sciences, Promega, American Girl, Sub-Zero, Lands' End, Spectrum Brands, a regional office for Google, and the University Research Park, as well as many biotechnology and health systems startups. Madison is a popular visitor destination, with tourism generating over $1 billion for Dane County's economy in 2018.\n\nHistory\nNative Americans\nBefore Europeans, humans inhabited the area in and around Madison for about 12,000 years. The Ho-Chunk called the region Teejop (pronounced Day-JOPE [J as in Jump]) meaning \"land of the four lakes\" (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa). Numerous effigy mounds, constructed for ceremonial and burial purposes over 1,000 years earlier, dotted the rich prairies around the lakes.\n\nFounding\nMadison's modern origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge James Duane Doty purchased over a thousand acres (4 km2) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. He purchased 1,261 acres for $1,500. When the Wisconsin Territory was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in Belmont, Wisconsin. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering buffalo robes to the freezing legislators and choice lots in Madison at discount prices to undecided voters. He had James Slaughter plat two cities in the area, Madison and \"The City of Four Lakes\", near present-day Middleton.\nDoty named his city Madison for James Madison, the fourth President of the U.S. who had died on June 28, 1836, and he named the streets for the other 38 signers of the U.S. Constitution. Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28, 1836, in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around Milwaukee in the east and the long-established strategic post of Prairie du Chien in the west, and between the highly populated lead mining regions in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, Green Bay, in the northeast.\n\nExpansion\nThe cornerstone for the Wisconsin capitol was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838. On October 9, 1839, Kintzing Prichett registered the plat of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial Dane County. Madison was incorporated as a village in 1846, with a population of 626. When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and the following year it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison). The Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad (a predecessor of the Milwaukee Road) connected to Madison in 1854. Madison incorporated as a city in 1856, with a population of 6,863, leaving the unincorporated remainder as a separate Town of Madison. The original capitol was replaced in 1863 and the second capitol burned in 1904. The current capitol was built between 1906 and 1917.\nDuring the Civil War, Madison served as a center of the Union Army in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago, and North Streets is known as Union Corners because a tavern there was the last stop for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. Camp Randall, on the west side of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and Camp Randall Stadium was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for ROTC training.\n\n1960s and 1970s\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison counterculture was centered in the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, referred to as \"Miffland\". The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the co-operative grocery store, the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of the Republican mayor Bill Dyke. Dyke was viewed by students as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the Vietnam War because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual Mifflin Street Block Party became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations, with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:\n\nthe 1967 student protest of Dow Chemical Company, with 74 injured;\nthe 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which resulted in the involvement of the Wisconsin Army National Guard;\nthe 1970 fire that caused damage to the Army ROTC headquarters housed in the University of Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium, also known as the Red Gym; and\nthe 1970 late-summer predawn ANFO bombing of the Army Mathematics Research Center in Sterling Hall, killing a postdoctoral researcher, Robert Fassnacht. (See Sterling Hall bombing)\nThese protests were the subject of the 1979 documentary The War at Home. David Maraniss's 2004 book, They Marched into Sunlight, incorporated the 1967 Dow protests into a larger Vietnam War narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book Rads on the subject (ISBN 0-06-092428-4). Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual Mifflin Street Block Party \"would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to Langdon Street's fraternity row. Tear gas hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus.\" In the fracas, student activist Paul Soglin, then a city alderman, was arrested twice and taken to jail. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving several times.\n\n21st century\nIn early 2011, Madison was the site for large protests against a bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker that abolished almost all collective bargaining for public worker unions. The protests at the capitol ranged in size from 10,000 to over 100,000 people and lasted for several months.\nOn October 31, 2022, the city of Madison annexed the majority of the remaining Town of Madison.\n\nGeography\nMadison is located in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, 77 miles (124 km) west of Milwaukee and 122 miles (196 km) northwest of Chicago. Madison completely surrounds the city of Monona, and the villages of Maple Bluff and Shorewood Hills. Madison shares borders with its largest suburb, Sun Prairie, and three other suburbs, Middleton, McFarland, and Fitchburg. Other suburbs include the city of Verona and the villages of Cottage Grove, DeForest, and Waunakee as well as Mount Horeb, Oregon, Stoughton, and Cross Plains.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 94.03 square miles (243.54 km2), of which 76.79 square miles (198.89 km2) is land and 17.24 square miles (44.65 km2) is water.\nThe city is sometimes described as The City of Four Lakes, comprising the four successive lakes of the Yahara River: Lake Mendota (\"Fourth Lake\"), Lake Monona (\"Third Lake\"), Lake Waubesa (\"Second Lake\") and Lake Kegonsa (\"First Lake\"), although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it. A fifth smaller lake, Lake Wingra, is within the city as well; it is connected to the Yahara River chain by Wingra Creek. The Yahara flows into the Rock River, which flows into the Mississippi River. Downtown Madison is located on an isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona. The city's trademark of \"Lake, City, Lake\" reflects this geography. The city's lowest elevation is the intersection of Regas Road and Corporate Drive on the east side, at 836.9 ft (255.1 m).

Detractors often refer to Madison as \"77 square miles surrounded by reality\", a phrase coined by former Wisconsin Republican governor Lee S. Dreyfus, while campaigning in 1978. In 2013, there was a motion in the city council to turn Dreyfus' humor into the official city \"punchline\", but it was voted down by the city council.\nThe city's voters are generally much more liberal than voters in the rest of Wisconsin. For example, 76% of Madison voters voted against a 2006 state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, even though the ban passed statewide with 59% of the vote.\nIn 1992, a local third party, Progressive Dane, was founded.

The Wisconsin State Journal (weekday circulation: ~95,000; Sundays: ~155,000) is published in the mornings, while its sister publication, The Capital Times (Thursday supplement to the Journal) is published online daily, with two printed editions a week. Though jointly operated under the name Capital Newspapers, the Journal is owned by the national chain Lee Enterprises, and the Times is independently owned. Wisconsin State Journal is the descendant of the Wisconsin Express, a paper founded in the Wisconsin Territory in 1839. The Capital Times was founded in 1917 by William T. Evjue, a business manager for the State Journal who disagreed with that paper's editorial criticisms of Wisconsin Republican Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. for his opposition to U.S. entry into World War I.\nThe free weekly alternative newspaper Isthmus (weekly circulation: ~65,000) was founded in Madison in 1976. The Onion, a satirical weekly, was founded in Madison in 1988 and published from there until it moved to New York in 2001. Two student newspapers are published during the academic year, The Daily Cardinal (Mon\u2013Fri circulation: ~10,000) and The Badger Herald (Mon\u2013Fri circulation: ~16,000).

La Follette's magazine, The Progressive, founded in 1909, is still published in Madison. It is a far left-wing periodical that may be best known for the attempt of the U.S. government in 1979 to suppress one of its articles before publication. The magazine eventually prevailed in the landmark First Amendment case, United States v. The Progressive, Inc. During the 1970s, there were two radical weeklies published in Madison, known as TakeOver and Free for All, as well as a Madison edition of the Bugle-American underground newspaper.\n\nRadio\nMadison has three large media companies that own the majority of the commercial radio stations within the market. These companies consist of iHeartMedia, Entercom Communications, and Mid-West Family Broadcasting as well as other smaller broadcasters. Madison is home to Mid-West Family Broadcasting, which is an independently owned broadcasting company that originated and is headquartered in Madison. Mid-West Family owns radio stations throughout the state and the Midwest.\nMadison hosts two volunteer-operated and community-oriented radio stations, WORT and WSUM. WORT Community Radio (89.9 FM), founded in 1975, is one of the oldest volunteer-powered radio stations in the United States. A listener-sponsored community radio station, WORT offers locally produced diverse music and talk programming. WSUM (91.7 FM) is a free-form student radio station programmed and operated almost entirely by students.\nMadison's Wisconsin Public Radio station, WHA, was one of the first radio stations in the nation to begin broadcasting. Public radio programs that originate at the WPR studios include Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?, Zorba Pastor On Your Health, To the Best of Our Knowledge, Calling All Pets, and the longest running radio program in America, Chapter a Day.\nWXJ-87 is the NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards station on Madison's west side, with broadcasts originating from the National Weather Service in Sullivan, Wisconsin.\n\nTV\nMadison has six commercial stations, two public television stations and a religious station.

WMWD-LD (Daystar) also serves the area. Madison has two public television stations: WHA-TV, which is owned by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Extension and airs throughout the state with the exception of Milwaukee, and cable's Madison City Channel, which is owned and operated by the City of Madison covering city governmental affairs.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nMadison is served by the Dane County Regional Airport, which serves nearly 2.2 million passengers annually. Most major general aviation operations take place at Middleton Municipal Airport in Middleton 15 miles (24 km) from Madison's city center. Metro Transit operates bus routes throughout the city and to some neighboring suburbs. Madison has two taxicab companies (Union Cab and Madison Taxi), and several companies provide specialized transit for individuals with disabilities. Several carsharing services are also available in Madison.\nStarting from the last decades of the 20th century, Madison has been among the leading cities for bicycling as a form of transportation, with about 3% of working residents pedaling on their journey to work. The share of Madison workers who bicycled to work increased to 5.3% by 2014. The 2016 survey by American Community Survey indicated that 65.7% of working Madison residents commuted by driving alone, 6.7% carpooled, 8.6% used public transportation, and 8.5% walked. About 6% used all other forms of transportation, including bicycles, motorcycles, and taxis. About 4.5% worked at home. According to Walk Score, Madison has an overall 48 out of 100 in walkability, making it a \"largely car dependent city\", and a 65 out of 100 for bicycling. However, the State-Langdon and Downtown areas scored significantly higher, 94 and 93 for walkability, and 87 and 89 for biking, respectively.\nIn 2015, 11.2% of Madison households were without a car, which was unchanged in 2016. The national average was 8.7% in 2016. Madison averaged 1.5 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.\n\nRailways\nPassenger train service between Madison and Chicago on the Sioux and the Varsity was provided by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) until 1971. The Chicago and North Western Railway also provided service to the east side of Madison, ending in 1965.\nThe city is served by the Columbus Amtrak station 28 miles (45 km) to the northeast with once daily trains to Chicago, Portland, OR and Seattle, WA and stops in between via the Empire Builder route. Although located outside of the city proper, the station is listed on Amtrak timetables as Madison's official stop.\nA high-speed rail route from Chicago through Milwaukee and Madison to Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, Minnesota, was proposed as part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. Funding for the railway connecting Madison to Milwaukee was approved in January 2010, but then Governor-elect Scott Walker's opposition to the project led the Federal Railroad Administration to retract the $810 million in funding and reallocate it to projects in other states.\nPlans to establish Amtrak service within the city of Madison were revived in 2021. Pending federal legislative action, Madison is again slated to receive a rail link to Chicago via Milwaukee, likely with an expansion of the Hiawatha Service. Longer-term plans include a connection to the Twin Cities, potentially via Eau Claire; however, this has not been officially established. Anticipating eventual revival of passenger service, public meetings were held in early 2024 by the city's Department of Transportation to consider possible site(s) for the station.\nRailroad freight services are provided to Madison by the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad (WSOR) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).\n\nBuses\nIn addition to public transportation, regional buses connect Madison to Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, and many other communities. Badger Bus, which connects Madison and Milwaukee, runs several trips daily. Greyhound Lines, a nationwide bus company, serves Madison on its Chicago, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul route. Van Galder Bus Company, a subsidiary of Coach USA, provides transportation through Rockford to Chicago\u2014stopping at Union Station, O'Hare Airport, and Midway Airport. Jefferson Lines provides transportation to Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul via La Crosse. Megabus provides limited-stop service to Chicago and Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul. Lamers Bus Lines has once-daily trips from Madison to Wausau, Dubuque, and Green Bay.\n\nHighways\nInterstate 39 (I-39), I-90 and I-94 run along the far east side of the city, connecting to Janesville to the south, Milwaukee to the east, and to Portage, La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Wausau heading north and northwest.\nU.S. Highway 151 (US 151) runs through downtown and serves as the main thoroughfare through the northeast (as Washington Avenue) and south-central parts (as Park Street) of the city, connecting Madison with Dubuque, Iowa to the southwest and Fond du Lac and Manitowoc to the northeast.\nUS 12, frequently referred to by locals as the Beltline, is a six- to eight-lane freeway serving the south and west sides of Madison and is the main link from the western suburb of Middleton to Cambridge. Southeast of the area, US 12 connects to Lake Geneva, and going northwest, it heads to Wisconsin Dells.\nUS 18 is also a component highway of the Beltine, continuing south along US 151 and east towards Waukesha and Milwaukee.\n\nPublic safety\nMadison Police Department\nThe Madison Police Department is the law enforcement agency in the city led by Police Chief Shon Barnes. The department has six districts: Central, East, North, South, West and Midtown District\nSpecial units in the police department include:\n\nThe Madison Police Department was criticized for absolving Officer Steve Heimsness of any wrongdoing in the November 2012 shooting death of an unarmed man, Paul Heenan. The department's actions resulted in community protests, including demands that the shooting be examined and reviewed by an independent investigative body. WisconsinWatch.org called into question the MPD's facts and findings, stating that the use of deadly force by Heimsness was unwarranted. There were calls for an examination of the Madison Police Department's rules of engagement and due process for officers who use lethal force in the line of duty.\nCommunity criticism of the department's practices resurfaced after MPD officer Matt Kenny shot Tony Robinson, an unarmed man. The shooting was particularly controversial given the context of the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement. Due to new Wisconsin state legislation that addresses the mechanisms under which officer-on-civilian violence is handled by state prosecutors, proceedings were handed over to a special unit of the Wisconsin Department of Justice in Madison. On March 27, 2015, the state concluded its investigation and gave its findings to Ismael Ozanne, the district attorney of Dane County. On May 12, 2015, Ozanne determined that the shooting was justified self-defense.\n\nMadison Fire Department\nThe Madison Fire Department (MFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city. The MFD operates out of 14 fire stations, with a fleet of 12 engines, 5 ladders, 2 rescue squads, 2 hazmat units, a lake rescue team, and 9 ambulances. The MFD is contracted to provide fire and EMS services to the suburban enclave village of Shorewood Hills and also provides mutual aid to surrounding communities. In 2021 MFD in conjunction with Journey Mental Health, launched an emergency mental health response team consisting of a paramedic and social work to respond to mental health emergencies, the program initially launched in the Isthmus area and has expanded citywide in 2022.\n\nNotable people\nNicknames\nOver the years, Madison has acquired nicknames and slogans that include:\n\nMad City\nMadtown\nThe Berkeley of the Midwest\n77 square miles surrounded by reality\nFour Lakes City\nPeople's Republic of Madison\n\nSister cities\nMadison is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Madison\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBates, Tom, Rads: The 1970 Bombing of the Army Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and Its Aftermath (1993) ISBN 0-06-092428-4\nDurrie, Daniel S.

                    "wiki": "The Mifflin Street Block Party is an annual block party celebration held on Mifflin Street in Madison, Wisconsin. The party is held on the last Saturday of April and attended predominantly by students attending the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Originally a political protest, it has since become more focused on socializing and alcohol consumption before final exams.  \nThe party has typically featured local and out-of-state musical acts playing on house porches, balconies and backyard stages. The party has not had city sponsorship since 2012. Efforts by the university and the city to create competing events have been unsuccessful. It is one of two large parties held in Madison, the other being the Freakfest Halloween party on State Street.\n\nHistory\nThe Mifflin Street Block Party began in 1969 as a street protest, which involved dancing in protest against the Vietnam War. Its original date, May 3, was set to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the French student rebellion. Anti-war sentiments had accelerated in Madison since the 1967 Dow Chemical protest in which thousands of students occupied and were violently expelled from Ingraham Hall. The original event arose as part of a continuing conflict between students and police, centered on Mifflin Street. Police refused to allow permission for the street dance and when they entered the area in response to a noise complaint, a confrontation ensued that lasted three nights and spread into the surrounding student areas. Students threw stones at the police and constructed barricades to defend themselves. The police responded with tear gas and billy clubs. At the end, 70 people were injured and more than 100 arrested, including future mayor, Paul Soglin.\nThe event continued annually for the duration of the war, despite the effects of the nearby Sterling Hall bombing. In an attempt to control the event, the city created \"Mifflin on the Mall\" in 1979 with music and concessions on State Street Mall. By 1982, however, students had once again taken to Mifflin Street. Under sponsorship from the Mifflin Co-op, the block party was often used as a community fundraiser for various political or social causes. The co-op dropped its greater involvement in 1991 after the city requested that organizers keep alcohol within fenced-in beer gardens.\n\nBy 1990, police had decided to not have any officers patrol the event and removed any official presence from the party. Despite crowds in excess of 10,000 no major problems occurred until a riot in 1996. Following this event, the city and police took more control in planning. They now effectively dictate the terms of the party, spending in excess of $80,000 on policing.\nOn May 4, 1996, a riot broke out when a crowd of several thousand people threw bottles at a fire truck that had come to put out a bonfire started by the crowd to combat the cold weather. Police used riot gear to retake the block. The riots resulted in thousands of dollars of damage. The 1997 event was planned very carefully but attracted few people due to poor weather. No major riots have occurred since 1996.\n\n21st century\nThe block party occurred on the first Saturday of May every year until 2005 when students lobbied to have the date changed to the last Saturday in April to avoid conflicts with final exams. Mayor Dave Cieslewicz refused the date change at first, citing the additional cost and strain it would place on the police. After students vowed to throw a large celebration both weekends, the mayor agreed to move the date of the block party with a promise from student leaders that they would discourage celebrations in the first week in May. However, the mayor requested that the Associated Students of Madison pay for the additional costs of moving the date. The 2005 event was considered one of the calmest on record, with 225 arrests and 317 citations, including the arrest of the football team's running back, Booker Stanley. The block party was scheduled for Saturday, April 29 by city officials in 2006. \nIn 2009 the city allowed local promotional group DCNY Pro to officially sponsor the event. This would be the first time in over a decade the city had allowed a sponsor. With support from WSUM radio station they produced one live music stage at the intersection of Bassett and Mifflin street. This year attendance grew to 15,000 but arrests declined to 164. \"Authorities credit official sponsors with the decrease in incidents. DCNY productions brought in a music stage, security staff, and food vendors.\"\nIn 2010, DCNY Pro once again sponsored the event partnering with WSUM Radio and Maximum Ink to produce two stages, one DJ stage at Bassett and Mifflin street and another Live music stage at Bedford and Mifflin street. The city also granted the sponsored a small beer garden in a parking lot on the 400 block of Mifflin street.\nIn 2011, open alcoholic beverages were allowed in the street for individuals of legal drinking age if they had a wristband. Madison police reported that this change was an attempt to bring people from backyards into the streets to allow for greater observation. The Majestic Theater, a local music venue, officially sponsored and hosted the event attempting to a put greater emphasis on music. Police officers reported the crowd size, and the number of significantly intoxicated people was far greater in 2011 likely due to the change in open intoxicants rules which resulted in more underaged drinking arrests. 160 people were arrested, two people were stabbed, and multiple police officers were injured during the 2011 event.\nIn 2012, Montee Ball, a Heisman Award candidate was cited for trespassing. Patrick Kane, a star forward for the Chicago Blackhawks, reportedly choked a woman at a house party and made anti-Semitic slurs. Photos surfaced of him drinking heavily, yelling at police officers, and passed out at a local bar. The party coincided with Cinco de Mayo celebrations throughout the country. This resulted in the event drawing the condemnation of UW-Madison Dean of Students Lori Berquam.\nAfter months of speculation regarding the annual block party, the City of Madison released a statement officially cancelling the block party effective April 12, 2013, and warned of severe punishments for violators. The release also indicated that a student-created music festival was to be held the same day. However, three days after the apparent cancellation of the party, the City of Madison announced that it had not in fact cancelled the annual gathering, blaming the confusion on poor wording of the previously released statement.\nSoglin had favored shutting the event down. Since he had attended the first one, this drew accusations of hypocrisy. At the 2012 event some attendees sold T-shirts mocking him, using the image of his face from the city's website with \"Sorry for Partying\" next to it. The photographer sued the T-shirt makers and their printer for copyright infringement since they had not sought permission to use the photo and he promised his subjects he would never let their photos be used negatively against them. At trial it was ruled to be fair use; the verdict was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2014.\nIn 2018, the party was reportedly calmer and more orderly. There were anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 attendees, more than 2016 and 2017 combined.\nIn 2020, the party was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Police were seen patrolling the streets throughout the day. Houses that were playing music that was audible from the street were given a police warning to turn it off or else they would be in violation of a new city ordinance. The street was historically quiet for the day.\nOn April 25, 2021, thousands of students gathered for the block party despite the city's ongoing COVID-19 protocols. Despite the controversy, Madison police reported that only four people were ticketed during the event. However, a group of students vandalized a university staff member's vehicle.\n\nPolice control\nBetween 1998 and 2002, attendance ranged from several hundred to a couple thousand. In 2002, however, an unexpected 20,000 people showed up for the event. That same year, a riot during Madison's Halloween festivities prompted police to begin systematically clamping down on the Mifflin event. The city has consistently refused proposals by students to close the street and revive the block party under student control. A Madison police lieutenant was quoted as saying, \"Quite frankly, we wish this event would go away.\" Since 2002, there have been an increased number of arrests and a decrease in attendance. The majority of arrests are for alcohol-related incidents.\nPolice have dealt with the event by heavily enforcing a number of ordinances. This has included the banning of glass containers on Mifflin, the limiting of the number of kegs that a house party can have, and the creation of a processing center for dealing with those arrested. Police are also notorious for handing out open container citations and targeting especially loud and raucous house parties. In 2004, one house received $25,000 in fines for \"selling alcohol without a permit.\" In 2005, police arrested 225 people and issued 317 citations. The cost to the city was $100,600 and issued $85,000 in fines, most of which was dismissed or reduced.\nThe Madison Police Department reported 60 arrests in 2018, and most offenses were for consuming alcohol in the street, public urination, or carrying glass containers.\n\nSee also\nLa Fete de Marquette\nState Street Halloween Party\nGreat Midwest Marijuana Harvest Festival\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistory of the Mifflin Street Co-op.

                    "wiki": "Memorial Union is located on the south shore of Lake Mendota on the campus of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. On the lakeshore to the north of the building is the Terrace, a popular outdoor space overlooking the lake. It has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus.\n\nHistory\nThe exterior of the main wing was designed by University Architect Arthur Peabody. Opened on October 5, 1928, the facility is operated by the Wisconsin Union, a membership organization. Porter Butts, the first director, called it a \"college union\" because it combines the characteristics of a student union (\"student activity center\" in other countries) and a student government (\"students' union\" in other countries) in an organization that brings together students, faculty, and members of the surrounding community.\nIn 1938, the Theater wing opened. It was supposed to be a mirror image of the east wing. However, the project was delayed several years due to financial issues. The final look was very different than it was supposed to.\nIn 1956, the cafeteria was renovated and expanded beyond the existing building envelope. Stone that was removed from the exterior wall was reused to rip-rap the lakeshore.\nThe cafeteria was renovated again in 1982, and again later in 2002, when it was renamed the Lakefront on Langdon.\nIn 2005, a referendum to build a new Union South and to renovate Memorial Union failed, but a new referendum happened again in 2006, and this time it passed. Construction began in summer of 2012 and wrapped up in September 2017. These renovations included a redesign of the Terrace, a renovation of the Wisconsin Union Theater, the addition of new restaurants and study spaces, and the addition of the 1.3-acre Alumni Park, which opened in fall of 2017, and the addition of an underground loading dock, which also serves the adjacent Red Gym and Pyle Center.\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 2015.\n\nMemorial Union reinvestment\nBuilding improvements were performed in two phases.\n\nPhase I\nPhase I lasted from 2012 to 2014, renovating the west wing. A chunk connecting the theater to the main building was demolished and rebuilt in order to allow for a new elevator and to address accessibility issues. The Hoofers area was rebuilt too, and a new hallway was built out to the lakeshore.\nThe Craftshop was relocated to the lower level, the Play Circle theater was rebuilt as a black box theater, a new entrance was added, a new reception area, and a new Sunset Lounge was added in front of the theater entrance. The main theater was renamed Shannon Hall.\n\nPhase II\nPhase II renovated the central core and east wings and terrace, as well as converting the parking lot into Alumni Park. A new underground loading dock was built under the park, allowing direct connection to the basement kitchens and storage areas. The loading dock also was built to serve the adjacent Red Gym and Pyle Center which eliminated the above-ground loading docks. The interior renovation included the dining areas, basement kitchen, Rathskeller, Great Hall, Main Lounge, and Tripp Commons.\nMost of the Union and Terrace closed in September 2015. The Rathskeller remained open until February but the serving area was closed. A temporary sandwich bar called the Subskeller was installed.\nMuch of the terrace reopened in May 2016 for graduation weekend, and the first floor/basement opened the following December. The remaining areas reopened in September 2017.\n\nFacility\nOutside the main building is the Memorial Union Terrace, a stone outdoor dining and recreation area on the shore of Lake Mendota. The Terrace was designed by Peabody's daughter, Charlotte. It is a popular spot among students and local residents for socializing because of the backdrop of the lake, with its view of sailboats, and the sound of live music, usually free to the public in the evening. The Wisconsin Union Directorate funds music on the Terrace four nights a week in the summer, and on the Terrace or in der Rathskeller on weekends during the school year (depending on weather).\nWithin the Union are rooms and artworks reflecting the local heritage. The largest is Der Rathskeller, a German-style beerhall with elaborate murals, where political debates and card or board games are common among students over a beer. Der Rathskeller directly connects the ground floor to the Terrace outside. Also on the ground floor are the Paul Bunyan Room and dining areas. Upstairs are the Beefeater Room and the Old Madison Room. The west wing of the Union houses the Wisconsin Union Theater and Wisconsin Hoofers.\nThe Daily Scoop sells Babcock ice cream made at the university. Peet's Coffee Shop is a privately managed operation that serves coffee and pastries. The Campus and Community Information desk acts as an information and referral resource. There is a small retail shop offers newspapers, apparel, and snacks. The Memorial Union Box Office offers ticketing for campus events as well as bus tickets for the Van Galder Bus Line. Memorial Union houses several restaurants and cafeterias. A catering department serves conferences, events for the university, and weddings of Union members, and the annual Tudor Dinners.\nThe Hoofers, an activity group headquartered in the Union, offer activities on Lake Mendota and other outdoor sites.\nAdjacent to the Union and Terrace is the 1.3-acre Alumni Park. The park is an art gallery and museum displaying the accomplishments of Badgers throughout the 17 decades of the university. Beneath the park is an underground loading dock, which serves the Union as well as the adjacent Red Gym, Pyle Center, and Alumni House.\n\nBuilding\nThe building has three main wings.\nThe central core is the grand historical wing. The grand entrance goes right into Memorial Hall on the second floor then into the Main Lounge. The main lounge is flanked by the Hamel Browsing Library on the left and the art gallery on the right. The central core includes two grand staircases.\nThe first floor of the central core contains Der Rathskeller, flanked by Der Stiftskeller on the left and the serving bar on the right. Under the grand entrance is the trophy room and bathrooms. The Paul Bunyan room is located south of the west grand staircase.\nOn the fourth floor of the central core contains the great hall, also known as the dance hall. The great hall has a balcony above the grand entrance.\nThe fifth floor contains offices.\nThe east wing, historically known as the Commons wing, contains most of the indoor dining areas on the first floor. On the second floor is Tripp Commons, and the upper floors contain mostly meeting rooms. The hotel rooms are located on the fourth floor.\nThe west wing contains the theater, Wheelhouse studios, and Wisconsin Hoofers.\n\nImage gallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nWisconsin Union website\nThe Wisconsin Union\u2014The First 75 Years (1904-79), interviews with Wisconsin Union Director Porter F.

                    "wiki": "The Wisconsin State Capitol, located in Madison, Wisconsin, houses both chambers of the Wisconsin Legislature along with the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the Office of the Governor. Completed in 1917, the building is the fifth to serve as the Wisconsin capitol since the first territorial legislature convened in 1836 and the third building since Wisconsin was granted statehood in 1848. The Wisconsin State Capitol is the tallest building in Madison, a distinction that has been preserved by legislation that prohibits buildings taller than the 187 feet (57 m) columns surrounding the dome. The Capitol is located at the southwestern end of the Madison Isthmus in downtown Madison, bordered by streets that make up the Capitol Square.\n\nHistory\nThe first capitol was a prefabricated wood-frame council house without heat or water that had been sent hastily to Belmont. Legislators met there for 42 days after Belmont was designated the capital of Wisconsin Territory. The session chose Madison as the site of the capitol, and Burlington, Iowa, as the site of further legislative sessions until Madison could be ready. The council house and an associated lodging house still stand and are operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society as the First Capitol Historic Site.\nThe second capitol was constructed in 1837 in Madison of stone cut from Maple Bluff and oak cut locally. Located on the site of the present capitol, it was a small but typical frontier capitol that cost $60,000 to build . Growing government needs forced the state to construct a new capitol on the same site. This structure, with a similar U.S. Capitol-inspired dome, was designed by Madison architects August Kutzbock and Samuel Donnel and built between 1857 and 1869. During 1882, it was expanded at a cost of $900,000, with two wings to the north and south. In 1903, however, a commission began researching replacement of the structure.\nOn the night of February 26, 1904, a gas jet ignited a newly varnished ceiling in the third capitol building. Although the building had an advanced fire-fighting system, the nearby University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's reservoir, which supplied the capitol, was empty, allowing the fire to spread substantially before the switch to alternative city water supplies could be made. Madison firefighters could not handle the blaze on their own, so additional men and equipment had to be brought from Milwaukee. The effectiveness of the reinforcements was initially hampered by very cold temperatures; by the time they reached Madison, their equipment had frozen and needed to be thawed. As a result, the entire structure, except the north wing, burned to the ground. Numerous records, books, and historical artifacts were lost, including the mount of Old Abe, a Civil War mascot. However, through the efforts of university students, much of the state law library was saved. The fire occurred just after the state legislature had voted to cancel the capitol's fire insurance policy.\n\nConstruction and design\nConstruction of the present capitol, the fourth building and the third in Madison, began in late 1906 and was completed in 1917 at a cost of $7.25 million. The architect was George B. Post & Sons from New York. He made the Capitol look the same on every side so that none of the businesses on the Square felt like they were on the back side. Because of financial limitations and the need for immediate office space to house state government employees, the construction of the new building was extended over several years and emphasized building one wing at a time.\nThe Capitol is 284 feet, 5 inches tall from the ground floor to the top of the Wisconsin statue on the dome. The Wisconsin statue on the dome was sculpted in 1920 by Daniel Chester French of New York. Its left hand holds a globe surmounted by an eagle and her right arm is outstretched to symbolize the state motto, \"Forward\". It wears a helmet with the state animal, the badger, on top. It is made of hollow bronze covered with gold leaf. Wisconsin is 15 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs three tons. The statue is commonly misidentified as Lady Forward or Miss Forward, which is the name of another statue on the capitol grounds.\nThe capitol ceiling, visible from the center of the building, features Resources of Wisconsin, a mural by Edwin Howland Blashfield. Due to the domed shape of the ceiling, the mural was painted in pieces and was assembled similarly to a jigsaw puzzle. It features a woman sitting on a throne of clouds, representing Wisconsin. Wisconsin is surrounded by other women, wrapped in a large American Flag, who are reaching for goods such as tobacco, lead, and fruits.\nThe capitol was constructed of 43 types of stone from six countries and eight states. The exterior stone is Bethel white granite from Vermont, making the exterior dome the largest granite dome in the world. The corridor floors, walls and columns are of marble from the states of Tennessee, Missouri, Vermont, Georgia, New York, and Maryland; granite from the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota; and limestone from the states of Minnesota and Illinois. Marble from the countries of France, Italy, Greece, Algeria and Germany, and syenite from Norway are also represented. Other Wisconsin granites are located throughout the public hallways on the ground, first, and second floors.\nThe building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. A 1990 state law prevents any building within one mile of the capitol from being taller than the base of the columns surrounding and supporting its dome.\n\nRestoration\nFrom 1988 to 2002, the capitol underwent a renovation and restoration project costing $158.8 million. The project was performed wing by wing, the same as the original construction of the capitol. The purpose of the project was to convert the capitol into a modern working building, while restoring and preserving its original 1917 appearance. Remodeling projects of the 1960s and 70s had introduced features out of character with the architecture of the building, such as dropped ceilings, movable partitions and fluorescent light fixtures, and many original decorative stencils were painted over. The restoration project returned public spaces to their original appearance. Original decorative stencils were repaired. Stairs, which had been sealed during the 1970s, were uncovered. The exterior granite was cleaned and repaired by workers who rappelled down from the dome. The renovation plan also included integrating modern technology into the original architecture. Electrical, mechanical (such as plumbing and heating), and communications systems were upgraded; asbestos was removed, and air conditioning was added. The capitol basement floor was lowered two feet to provide additional usable office space. Legislative offices were rebuilt as two-room suites (originally legislators did not have offices in the capitol, only their desks in the Senate and Assembly chambers). Modern office furniture was designed to look like the original oak furniture.\n\nSculpture program\nArchitect Post planned an elaborate sculpture program for the building. Initially the commission for the statue of Wisconsin on the top of the dome was promised to Helen Farnsworth Mears but when Daniel Chester French agreed to produce the finial figure, the commission was switched to him. This work, often referred to as the \"Golden Lady\", consists of an allegorical figure reminiscent of Athena, dressed in Greek garb, and wearing a helmet topped by a badger, the Wisconsin state totem. In the left hand it holds a globe with an eagle perched on top. Across its chest is a large W, for Wisconsin.\nPost's original concept for the building required four small domes to be placed at the base of the large one, but the plans were changed and the domes were replaced by four sculptural groups by Karl Bitter. These groups (again, in Greek clothing) symbolized Faith, Strength, Prosperity and Abundance and Knowledge.\nEach of the four wings of the building is fronted by a pediment whose figures relate to the principal activities that were to occur within. Thus the east wing, housing the Supreme Court, features a pediment by Bitter entitled Law; the south has Adolph Alexander Weinman's Virtues and Traits of Character, for the wing containing the State Senate. Bitter's other pediment, the west, is Agriculture, while Attilio Piccirilli's Wisdom and Learning of the World adorns the north pediment. The carving of all these sculptures is attributed to the Piccirilli Brothers.\n\nFossils\nNaturally occurring fossils are found throughout the capitol:\n\nStarfish: North wing, left grand stairs, 1st to 2nd floor, fourth step from bottom\nCoral: West wing, second floor, railing overlooking central corridor, outside of Assembly chamber\nNautiloid: North wing, second floor, left of north hearing room entrance\nGastropod: West wing, left grand stairs; 1st to 2nd floor railing, above 9th step from top\nAmmonoid: North wing, second floor, north hearing room\nBryozoan: South wing, second floor, left grand stairs, top step\nBurrows: Northwest, second floor, wall to right room 225 NW\nBrachiopods: East wing, ground floor, pillars near entrance\n\nImages\nSee also\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n2011 Wisconsin protests\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDennis, James M.
